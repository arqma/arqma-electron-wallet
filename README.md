# Arqma Electron GUI Wallet

### Introduction
Arqma is a private cryptocurrency based on Monero.
More information on the project can be found on the [website](https://arqma.com) and in the [whitepaper](https://arqma.github.io). Arqma is an open source project, and we encourage contributions from anyone with something to offer.


### About this project

### Adding language support

Adding a new language is fairly simple.

1. Duplicate the language file `src/i18n/en-us.js` and rename it to the relevant language code.
2. Translate all the strings in that duplicated file. Take note that capitalization matters.
    - The translated string must go in-between the quotes (`""`)
      - E.G `all: "ALL"` -> `all: "ВСЕ"`
    - If possible try and stick to the general string formatting already present.
      - E.G if there is a new line then try and keep that in your translation.
      - The same goes for the pipe character `|`. **DO NOT REMOVE IT**.
    - Please don't translate strings inside `{}` brackets. They are meant as placeholders for other values.
      - Some examples include `{type}` and `{count}`.
      - E.G if you have a string `A {index}` then you may translate it as `B {index}` or `{index} B` depending on how the string makes sense in your language. You are allowed to reposition the placeholders for the string to make sense **BUT DO NOT DELETE OR REPLACE THE PLACEHOLDERS WITH OTHER VALUES**
3. Add the language to the `languages` array in `src/i18n/index.js`. The `flag` property is the [ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/) of a country.
   - **NOTE: DO NOT ADD THE LANGUAGE TO `export default`**. Dynamic language loading is handled by the application.
4. Add your language locale to Vue Timeago. Add it in `src/plugins/timeago.js` under `locales`.

5. Submit a PR with your changes.
